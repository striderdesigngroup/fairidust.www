          <p><strong>The best way to know someone is to read their hands. Everyone's hands are different and posess a unique enlightenment into their lives and to forecast their future.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Did you know that in ancient history handprints were used to valadate official documents. Aristotle once wrote &quot;The lines are not written into the human hands without reason, they come from heavenly influences and man's own individuality&quot;. Even the bible has has many references, an example : as in Proverbs 3:16 &quot;Length of days in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The hands are vital and express our indiviuality starting from birth forming our identity. As we age the lines in our hands change and thus the essential rule in palmisty is the hand reveals tendencies not factuality.</strong></p>
          <p class="sub3">The basics of palmisty starts with the shape of the hand. There are 6 types:</p>
          <p><span class="sub1">Elementary:</span><strong> Primarily male hands and are earthy. Those that use their hands at work, such as capenters, farmers, heavy machinary, and other physical labor. Skin texture is coarse, fingers are stubby and the palm is broad and some what square but strong and threatening.</strong></p>
          <p><span class="sub1">Square:</span><strong> This hand is recognizable by the squared off finger tips. Usually hands of a planner. Someone very organzied, methodical and stable. Their palm and fingers are approximately the same length. Always uses common sense and may have difficulty with change in their life.</strong></p>
          <p><span class="sub1">Spatula:</span><strong> These people are energetic, self confident and sel reliant. Hands are broad and strong with slightly knotted fingers. Usually flat nails that fan out to form the spatula. These very pracitcal and dynamic people tend to work in commerce, are entepenuers, contractors, or maybe athletes.</strong></p>
          <p><span class="sub1">Conic:</span><strong> People who are emotional, intuitive, and impulsive. Very tapered fingers, skin texture is usually fine and silky. They show sensitivity and beauty. These romantic and sentimental people will have a few more lines than most others. Creativity runs high, but follow through is their short coming.</strong></p>
          <p><span class="sub1">Psychic:</span><strong> This hand is rare but distinctive. The hand is beautifully formed with graceful fingers. Nails tend to be oval, and palm has many lines. In addition to being psychic, they tend to be motivated by their deepest feelings. They tend to want to be grounded in the material world, while their need for spiritual, and nature side keep them balanced.</strong></p>
          <p><span class="sub1">Mixed:</span><strong> This is the hand that doesnt fit into any of the other forms. May have a combination of some of the other charateristic types. In this case depending on what part of the hand relates , example: Conic fingers would mean the person has beauty, while the nails are spatula and denotes a self confident individual. All factors have to be considered.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Now lets talk about the lines in our hands. The lines represent the paths of our life, and are ever changing with our body as it changes with time, such as a possible illness, maybe smoking, and just over time as we age. A balanced individual will have lines that are clear and well defined. However, deep lines should be noted as someone with much energy, while shallow lines are the opposite, denoting lack of strength and focus. A hand with many lines is someone that is hyperactive , sensitive to those around them and a hand with little lines will be lacking sensitivity and self exspression.</strong></p>
          <p class="sub3">The following are details of lines and what they represent:</p>
          <p><strong>- Splintering or splitting : A change or new phase in a persons life.<br/>
            - Lines of influence: small lines that cross major lines (events that have valuable life experience)<br/>
            - Islands: Indicate lack of focus and energy<br/>
            - Chain: indecisiveness, lack of energy<br/>
            - Fork: scattered energy, maybe balance and adaptability<br/>
            - Dot: a slight round color that indicates a physical or emotional set back<br/>
            - Grille: numerous criss crosses that indicate scattered energy, lack of decision<br/>
            - Square; four lines creating a rectangle, protection and preservation from any broken lines.</strong></p>
